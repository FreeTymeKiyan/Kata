# This is the KATA log of Pseudo Code of BFS

## Goal  
  
###First round  
  
1. To write BFS pseudo code in less than 3min.
2. Be correct in a row for 10 times
  
Achieved
Accuracy: 13 / 13 = 100.00%

###Second round  
  
1. less than 2min.
2. be correct in a row for 10 times.

## Accuracy
  
4 / 4 = 100%
  
## Reasons for wrong:
  
1. Added check whether an adjacent node is already visited or not in foreach loop to avoid repeated visit.
